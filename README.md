# Movie-Data-Project

Using this project as a way to test and grow my Python/SQL data-related skills. 

My objective is to leverage Trakt and Boxofficemojo.com's APIs to pull and perform analysis on movie data.

More information on the sources I'm using to collect this data: <br>
Trakt: https://trakt.docs.apiary.io (general movie data) <br>
Boxofficemojo: https://www.boxofficemojo.com (movie revenue data)
